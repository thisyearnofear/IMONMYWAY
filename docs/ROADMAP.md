# IMONMYWAY Enhancement Roadmap

## Current Status: AI Foundation Complete ✅

### Core Principles Implementation
- ✅ ENHANCEMENT FIRST: AI features built as enhancements to existing components
- ✅ AGGRESSIVE CONSOLIDATION: Removed unused code, consolidated services
- ✅ PREVENT BLOAT: Audited dependencies, optimized bundle size
- ✅ DRY: Single source of truth for AI logic and configuration
- ✅ CLEAN: Clear separation between blockchain and AI logic
- ✅ MODULAR: Composable, testable AI modules
- ✅ PERFORMANT: Adaptive processing with device-aware optimization
- ✅ ORGANIZED: Predictable file structure with domain-driven design

### Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Created AI service in `/lib/ai-service.ts`
- ✅ Created AI configuration in `/config/ai-config.ts`
- ✅ Enhanced `uiStore.ts` to include AI state management
- ✅ Created `useAIEngine` hook for AI functionality
- ✅ Enhanced existing components with AI integration

## Enhancement Opportunities: 3D Visualization & Performance

### Phase 2: Journey Visualization Enhancement - ✅ IN PROGRESS
Building on the existing Three.js foundation and inspired by flight tracker reference project:

#### 2.1: Journey Path Visualization - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Created `JourneyPathVisualization.tsx` with 3D curved path rendering
- ✅ Implemented status-based coloring and progress indicators
- ✅ Added performance optimization with instanced rendering for low-end devices
- ✅ Integrated with existing journey data models

#### 2.2: Interactive Dashboard - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Created `JourneyDashboard.tsx` with filtering and search functionality
- ✅ Implemented responsive design for mobile and desktop
- ✅ Added journey selection and detailed view capabilities

#### 2.3: Enhanced Tracking Page - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Enhanced `src/app/watch/[id]/page.tsx` with 3D visualization
- ✅ Added progress tracking and commitment details
- ✅ Implemented responsive layout with animated transitions

### Phase 3: Quality Improvements - ✅ COMPLETED

#### 3.1: Enhanced Error Handling - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Added comprehensive error states and recovery mechanisms
- ✅ Implemented graceful degradation for WebGL support
- ✅ Added retry functionality for failed data loading

#### 3.2: Mobile Optimization - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Implemented adaptive rendering quality for different devices
- ✅ Added touch-friendly interfaces and responsive layouts
- ✅ Optimized performance for low-end mobile devices

#### 3.3: Analytics Integration - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Created `useAnalytics.ts` hook for tracking user interactions
- ✅ Added event tracking for visualization components
- ✅ Implemented error tracking and user behavior analytics

#### 3.4: Accessibility Features - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Added proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- ✅ Created `useKeyboardNavigation.ts` hook for keyboard support
- ✅ Implemented focus management and screen reader compatibility
