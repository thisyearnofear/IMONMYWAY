- **Use** lazy initialization for heavy AI operations

### ORGANIZED - Predictable Structure
- **Domain-driven** organization: `/ai/core/`, `/ai/models/`, `/ai/hooks/`
- **Consistent** naming following existing patterns: `useAIRecommendations`, `AIDashboard`
- **Predictable** file structure aligned with current architecture
