# Core Principles Compliance

## Core Principles Overview

- **ENHANCEMENT FIRST**: Enhance existing components over replacement
- **AGGRESSIVE CONSOLIDATION**: Delete unnecessary code, single source of truth
- **PREVENT BLOAT**: Audit before adding features, no external dependencies
- **DRY**: Single source of truth for shared logic
- **CLEAN**: Clear separation of concerns, explicit dependencies
- **MODULAR**: Composable, testable, independent modules
- **PERFORMANT**: Adaptive loading, caching, resource optimization
- **ORGANIZED**: Predictable file structure, domain-driven design

## Compliance Achievements

## Functionality Preservation

### Zero Functionality Lost

All original features preserved and enhanced:

| Component  | Original Features         | Enhanced Features                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Button     | Basic variants, loading   | Async support, celebrations, haptic feedback |
| StakeInput | Validation, quick amounts | AI recommendations, context awareness        |
| BetCard    | Bet placement, display    | Unified interface, optimistic updates        |
| Navigation | Basic routing             | Wallet integration, network switching        |
